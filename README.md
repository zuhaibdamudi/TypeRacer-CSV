# TypeRacer CSV

TypeRacer does not allow you to download your historical race data without a premium account. This is a workaround where we perform web scraping using Selenium to extract this data into a CSV, and perform analysis.

## Requirements
 - selenium
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib

Download ChromeDriver depending on your version of Google Chrome from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), and put it in the same directory, before running the Jupyter Notebook.

*Note: This method of web scraping works perfectly as of November 2022.*
